# Deploy Bank of Z

The video below demonstrates a complete first-time deployment of Bank of Z using the Direct USS method. Starting from a z/OS environment with all prerequisites in place, it walks through cloning the repository to USS and running the three setup stages — which automatically provision a full application stack including CICS, IMS, z/OS Connect, and a Liberty frontend server, then build and deploy the application from source.

To deploy Bank of Z yourself, see [Deploying Bank of Z](../installation-and-setup/deploying.html).

**Tip:** Once Bank of Z has been deployed successfully, use the incremental build and deploy workflow (`pipeline-remote.sh`) during day-to-day development instead of performing a full deployment after every code change.
