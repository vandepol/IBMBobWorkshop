| setup-local.sh | Initiates setup activities from the developer workstation |
| setup-common.sh | Performs environment setup on z/OS USS |
| pipeline-local.sh | Initiates build and deployment processing |
| pipeline-remote.sh | Runs build and deployment activities on z/OS USS |

## Zowe CLI workflow commands

The Zowe CLI workflow is completed through a VS Code task or by running `setup-local.sh` directly.

Run the **Setup Bank of Z Environment** task from the Command Palette:

1. Open the Command Palette.
2. Run **Tasks: Run Task**.
3. Select **Setup Bank of Z Environment**.

For detailed workflow instructions, see [Zowe CLI Workflow](../development-workflows/zowe-cli-workflow.md).

## GRUB workflow commands

The GRUB workflow synchronizes local changes to USS and runs the Bank of Z setup process.

See to [GRUB Workflow](../development-workflows/grub-workflow.md) for environment-specific configuration and run procedures.
