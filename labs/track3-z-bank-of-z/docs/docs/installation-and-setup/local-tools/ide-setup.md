# IDE Setup

An IDE is required to browse, edit, and manage Bank of Z source code. For the best experience and to follow the tutorials in the documentation, use IBM Bob Premium Package for Z. Alternatively, you can use Visual Studio Code.

IDE setup is independent of your chosen deployment workflow. Complete this setup before continuing your deployment tooling.

## Prerequisites

Java 21 is required to run the IDE and its embedded tooling.

Install IBM Semeru Runtime for Java 21 or later, and then verify the installation:

```bash
java -version
```

## Required extensions

Install the following extensions in your IDE.

**Note:** If you are using IBM Bob Premium Package for Z and an extension is unavailable in the Open VSX Marketplace, download the VSIX package and install it manually.

**Note:** For IBM MQ there is no IBM extension in the VS Code Marketplace. See the [IBM MQ Console extension](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/dorothy-quincy/2026/05/08/ibm-mq-console-extension) available from the `ibm-messaging` GitHub group.

## Install extensions from a marketplace

1. Open the **Extensions** view in your IDE.
2. Search for the extension by name.
3. Select **Install**.

## Install VSIX packages manually

1. Download the VSIX file using the link in the table above.
2. Open the **Extensions** view.
3. Select **More Actions (…)** → **Install from VSIX…**
4. Browse to the downloaded file and complete the installation.

## Automated VSIX download and install

Bank of Z includes scripts to download and install all required VSIX packages in one step.

**Download all packages:**

```bash
node scripts/download-vsix.js [output-directory]
```

The default output directory is `./vsix-extensions`.

**Install into IBM Bob Premium Package for Z:**

```bash
# First add bobide to PATH:
# View > Command Palette > Shell Command: Install 'bobide' command in PATH

node scripts/install-bobide-vsix.js [output-directory]
```

**Install into VS Code:**

```bash
# First add code to PATH:
# View > Command Palette > Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH

node scripts/install-vscode-vsix.js [output-directory]
```

For more information, see [`scripts/README.md`](../../../../scripts/README.md).

## Verify the IDE configuration

After completing the installation:

1. Launch the IDE.
2. Confirm all required extensions are installed and enabled.
3. Open the Bank of Z repository and confirm that the workspace tasks are available from **Terminal** → **Run Task**.

## Next steps

Continue to [Zowe Profile Setup](zowe-profile-setup.html) to configure connectivity to your z/OS system.
